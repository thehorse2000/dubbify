Dubbify: Python Package Implementation Plan
Package Name: dubbify
Target Users: Developers
Core Functionality: Create AI-generated dubbed audio tracks for video/audio files using transcription and text-to-speech.

1. Overview & Core Features
dubbify will be a versatile Python package that streamlines the process of video and audio dubbing. It will function both as a command-line tool for quick, out-of-the-box usage and as a Python library (SDK) for integration into larger applications.

The process will be broken down into two main stages, which can be run together or separately:

Transcription: Extract the spoken words from a source media file (.mp4, .mov, .mp3, .wav) and generate a timed subtitle file (.srt). This is powered by OpenAI (Whisper-1).

Dubbing: Take an SRT file (either generated by dubbify or provided by the user) and a target language/voice, and generate a synchronized audio track using the ElevenLabs Text-to-Speech API (v3 model). The final output can be a standalone audio file (.mp3) or a new video file (.mp4) with the dubbed audio replacing the original.

Key Features:
One-Command Dubbing: A single CLI command to go from a video file to a final dubbed audio track or a fully dubbed video.

Flexible Output: Generate a standalone .mp3 audio file or a new .mp4 video with the dubbed audio.

Choice of Transcriber: OpenAI for transcription.

Modular Stages: Ability to run only the transcription or only the dubbing stage.

Multi-Language Support: Support for all languages offered by the underlying transcription and TTS services.

Voice Selection: Allow users to specify a voice ID for the TTS service.

API Key Management: Simple and secure handling of API keys via environment variables.

Python Library Interface: Clean and intuitive functions for developers to use in their own code.

Extensibility: The architecture will allow for future integration of different transcription or TTS providers.

2. Usage Specification
2.1. Command-Line Interface (CLI) Usage
The CLI will be the primary way for users to interact with dubbify. It will be built using a library like typer or click for robust command and option handling.

Installation:
pip install dubbify

Configuration:
Users must set their API keys as environment variables.

export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
export ELEVENLABS_API_KEY="your_elevenlabs_key"

Commands:
1. The dubbify (all-in-one) command:
This is the main command that performs the full end-to-end process.

dubbify run \
    --input "path/to/my_video.mp4" \
    --output "path/to/dubbed_video.mp4" \
    --voice "alloy" \
    --language "en"

--input: Path to the source video or audio file.

--output: Path for the final output. The file extension (.mp3 or .mp4) determines the output type.

--voice: (Optional) The name or ID of the ElevenLabs voice to use. Defaults to a standard voice.

--language: (Optional) The language of the speech in the source file (ISO 639-1 code). If not provided, the transcriber will auto-detect.

2. The dubbify transcribe command:
This command only performs the transcription step.

dubbify transcribe \
    --input "path/to/my_video.mp4" \
    --output "path/to/transcript.srt" \
    --language "en"

--input: Path to the source video or audio file.

--output: Path to save the generated .srt file.

--language: (Optional) Language code for the transcription model.


3. The dubbify dub command:
This command only performs the dubbing step, using a pre-existing SRT file.

dubbify dub \
    --input "path/to/transcript.srt" \
    --output "path/to/dubbed_audio.mp3" \
    --voice "alloy"

--input: Path to the source .srt file.

--output: Path for the final, synchronized MP3 audio track.

--voice: (Optional) The name or ID of the ElevenLabs voice.

2.2. Python Library (SDK) Usage
Developers can also import dubbify into their own projects to integrate its functionality.

Example Usage:
import os
from dubbify import Dubbify, DubbifyConfig

# It is recommended to load API keys from environment variables
# os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "..."
# os.environ["ELEVENLABS_API_KEY"] = "..."

# 1. Configure the job
config = DubbifyConfig(
    voice="Bella",
    language="en",
    
)

# 2. Initialize Dubbify with the config
dub_project = Dubbify(config=config)

# 3. Run the full end-to-end process to generate a new video
dub_project.run(
    input_path="path/to/video.mp4",
    output_path="path/to/dubbed_video.mp4"
)

# --- OR run steps individually ---

# Transcribe only
dub_project.transcribe(
    input_path="path/to/video.mp4",
    output_srt_path="path/to/transcript.srt"
)

# Dub from an existing SRT file
dub_project.dub(
    srt_path="path/to/transcript.srt",
    output_audio_path="path/to/dubbed_audio.mp3"
)


3. Project Structure
A standard Python package structure will be used.
